# <Calculator - using vanilla CSS, JS>

## Description

I wanted to test my understanding of functions and logic through a more intermediate project.
A JavaScript calculator is a popular beginner project. However, many examples for beginners only accept 2 operands either
via user input or will perform the operation immediately after the second operand has been detected. Thus, these examples
do not obey order of operations. 
The goal of this project was to see if I could implement the logic in order to obey order of operations.
